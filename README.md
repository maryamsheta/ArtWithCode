Who would have thought that just a few lines of code could create such amazing art? That’s exactly what I discovered with p5.js, and I’ve been having fun with it ever since. It perfectly combines my love for art and graphic design with my passion for programming, allowing me to express creativity in a whole new way!

This repository contains a growing collection of sketches that showcase my journey experimenting with p5.js.
I’m excited to continue expanding this collection and sharing my progress with you!
