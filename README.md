This is a collection of creative sketches made with p5.js. It combines my love for art and design with coding, using simple JavaScript to create visual experiments.

Each sketch is part of my journey exploring creative coding as I learn, experiment, and have fun with code.

Feel free to browse, get inspired, and follow along as I add more.
